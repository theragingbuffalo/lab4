<h1>Syllabus for MCS-378: Operating Systems (Fall 2019)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This course covers the basics of operating
systems as well as some material on concurrent programming,
middleware, and networking.  There are two principal
reasons why a course on operating systems is practical to take (as
opposed to just interesting), even if you never expect to be involved
in the development of an operating system (which most of you won't):
<ul>
<li>
Operating systems provide the classic application domain for certain
techniques that are useful in other contexts as well. In particular,
concurrent programming has traditionally been been an “operating
systems” topic but is now quite broadly applicable.  Other topics
that are no longer the sole province of operating systems include
resource allocation, security, and fault tolerance.
</li><li>
Although most of you won't write operating systems, you'll interface
with them.  You may write applications programs that make use of the
operating system's facilities.
You may be a system administrator who has to configure and tune an
operating system.
An
understanding of what goes on inside an operating system will allow
you to be more effective in roles like these.  You may even find
yourself tacking a new feature on in some small corner of an operating
system other people wrote.
</li></ul>

<h2>Office hours, OHS 314</h2>

<p>My office hours are Monday &amp; Friday 10:00-11:30, Tuesday &amp; Thursday 8:00-8:50
 and by appointment.  Any time I am in my office and the door is open,
 your are welcome to drop-in as well.  I will typically be on campus
 MTRF 8-2:30, with breaks for lunch and noon hockey.
  Feel free to send me email at <a href="mailto:jengelha@gustavus.edu">jengelha@gustavus.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>World Wide Web</h2>

All course materials will be available through my World Wide Web page.
The URL for this course is <a href="http://homepages.gac.edu/~jengelha/courses/F2019/MCS-378/">https://gustavus.edu/~jengelha/courses/F2019/MCS-378/</a>.
I am trying to keep this class paper free.  If you need physical copy of
class materials, come see me so I can talk you out of it.

<h2>Text and readings</h2>

The primary text for the course is
<a href="https://www.gac.edu/mcs/max/os-book/"><cite>Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting
Controlled Interaction</cite></a> by Max Hailperin, the current version of which is available online.
Recent conference papers serve as
additional required readings; you have access to these through the
syllabus on the web.
Those conference papers will form the basis for the student
presentations, described below.

<h2>Presentations</h2>

There will be seven or eight times in the semester when I sit back and relax and
let students teach the class instead.  Each time, a pair of students will have
50 minutes to lead discussion on one of the papers we read from a
conference.  The whole class will be expected to read the
paper at least casually, but the students leading the class will be
expected to have read it more carefully and done whatever it takes to
really understand it, which may involve additional background reading,
talking with me, etc.

<p>
Each pair of students will be responsible for setting up a meeting
with me the week before their presentation to go over it with me.
(You are welcome to additional consultations as well.)  At that
meeting, you should also give me three  straightforward
questions about your reading.  I will distribute these to the full
class.  All class members will submit their answers to these three
questions by 8:00 AM the day of your presentation, as a
way of making sure we all have a common starting point.
I will look through them and alert you before your
presentation if there are any common difficulties you might want to
address.  No late answers will be accepted for these questions because
their point is to lay the groundwork for the presentation.

</p><p>I will provide 
<a href="http://homepages.gac.edu/~jengelha/courses/F2019/MCS-378/oral-presentation-tips.html">a list of attributes that good presentations have</a>.  I ask that you think about these while preparing your presentation.

</p><p>I'm going to ask you to express a preference ranking for the
topics and will try, to the extent possible, to assign people to topics
based on that.  I suggest you read the abstracts of the papers to help determine your preferences; you can also take into account the timing of the presentations.
I'll need to have you
<a href="mailto:jengelha@gustavus.edu">email me</a> the rankings by class Wednesday September 11.

</p><p>I hope to update this list with more current papers on similar topics.  You are also welcome to propose alternate papers if you wish, but time is running short.

<h2>Daily preparation assignment</h2>

<p>Each class day that has a reading assignment, by 8:00 AM you are to enter on <a href="https://moodle.gac.edu/course/view.php?id=9041">Moodle</a>
your preparation assignment for that day.
(The first day of classes is excepted.)
I will look
these over in order to shape the class to meet your needs.  As
additional incentive, they 
provide an opportunity to earn Grade Points.
No late preparation assignments
are accepted, as that would undermine their real purpose.</p>

<p>For a conference paper, the
preparation assignment will consist of questions provided by the
presenters, as described in the section on presentations.</p>

<p>For readings from the textbook, your assignment is to send me an agenda
for that day's class.  Is there old business from prior days that you
see as needing more time?  In the new topics from that day's reading,
what are the main points we should cover?  What illustrations,
programs, or other examples from the book would you like to go over?
Are there exercises we should work?
Are there topics beyond the reading we ought to cover?
</p>

<h2>Independent exploration and programming projects</h2>

<p>
You have the opportunity to take on independent exploration and programming projects and thereby earn grade points.
Each 
chapter in the textbook ends with exercises, programming projects,
and exploration projects.
Of these three categories, the exercises are suitable for you to put
on a class agenda as something we could talk about or work on together. The other two categories are available for your independent projects.
For each of Chapters 2–11, you may submit via <a href="https://moodle.gac.edu/course/view.php?id=9041">Moodle</a> any programming or exploration project, subject to the
restrictions listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive credit for at most two projects in each chapter.
</li><li>You will not receive credit for Chapter 1.
</li><li>Each project must be submitted by one week after the last class that has reading from that chapter.
</li><li>You may not choose Programming Project 3.1,
Exploration Project 3.3,
Exploration Project
6.6, or Exploration Project 8.6.
</li></ul>
<p>Note that some projects in the text have fallen out of date relative to external software or resources. Be sure to ask for help if you are having trouble making adjustments to accommodate the present-day context.</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>There will be a midterm take-home test as shown on the
<a href="http://homepages.gac.edu/~jengelha/courses/F2019/MCS-378/syllabus.html#schedule">schedule</a> below and a final exam <!--<a href="https://gustavus.edu/registrar/finals.php">-->as scheduled by the registrar<!--</a>-->. If you have a conflict with a testing time, please
contact me as soon as possible to make an alternative arrangement.</p>

<p>My default assumption is that students will take the final together.
  Therefore, I would ask you to please be
  respectful and quiet, even after completing your exam, so that your
  fellow students have a good test-taking environment.
  However, if you prefer to take the exam in a
  separate room, please contact me in advance and I will try to
  arrange it.</p>

<p>
The midterm will be open-book and open-notes whereas the final will be closed-book and mostly closed-notes.  You may, however, use a
single 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper with <strong>hand-written</strong> notes for
reference.  (Both sides of the sheet are OK.)</p>


<h2>Honor</h2>
Students are encouraged to discuss the course, including issues raised
by the assignments.  However, the solutions to assignments
should be individual original work unless otherwise specified.  If an
assignment makes you realize you don't understand the material, ask a
fellow student a question designed to improve your understanding,
<em>not</em> one designed to get the assignment done.  To do otherwise is to
cheat yourself out of understanding as well as to be intolerably
dishonorable.

<p>
Any substantive contribution to your solution by another person or
taken from a publication should be properly acknowledged in writing.
Failure to do so is plagiarism and will necessitate disciplinary
action.

</p><p>
The same standards regarding plagiarism apply to team projects as to
the work of individuals, except that the author is now the entire team
rather than an individual.  Anything taken from a source outside the
team should be be properly cited.

</p><p>
One additional issue that arises from the team authorship of
project reports is that all team members must stand behind all reports
bearing their names.  All team members have quality assurance
responsibility for the entire project. If there is irreconcilable
disagreement within the team it is necessary to indicate as much in
the report.

</p><p>You are expected to be familiar with the college academic honesty
honor code policy and to comply with that policy.  If you have any
questions about it, please ask.</p>


<h2>Late lab assignments</h2>

All lab assignments are due at the beginning of class on
the day indicated.  Late assignments will be penalized by one Grade Point (10 percent)
for each weekday late or fraction
thereof.<p></p>

<p>
If you are too sick to complete an assignment on time, you
will not be penalized.  Simply notify me
in writing that the lateness is due to illness.  Other circumstances
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>


<h2>Grade changes</h2>

Please point out any arithmetic or clerical error I make in grading,
and I will gladly fix it.  You may also request reconsideration if I
have been especially unjust.


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>You will have the opportunity to earn up to 340 Grade Points (GP) throughout the semester as shown in the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Category</th><th>#</th><th>GP each</th><th>GP possible</th></tr>
<tr><td>Lab</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">30</td><td align="right">120</td></tr>

<!-- <tr><td>Lab extensions</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">20</td></tr> -->
<tr><td>Presentation</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">30</td><td align="right">30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Preparation</td><td align="right">30</td><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Projects</td><td align="right">20</td><td align="right">5</td><td align="right">50</td><td>additional 50 Extra credit</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test</td><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">30</td><td align="right">60</td></tr>

<tr><td>Total for grading</td><td align="right">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">290</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Your course grade will be recorded as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>GP</th><th>Grade</th></tr>
<tr><td align="right">270–290</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">261–269</td><td>A−</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">252–260</td><td>B+</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">240–251</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">232–239</td><td>B−</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">223–231</td><td>C+</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">211–222</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">203–210</td><td>C−</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">194–202</td><td>D+</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">182–193</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">0–181</td><td>F</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Style guidelines</h2>

All project and lab reports should be readily readable and should
not presuppose that I already know what you are trying to say.  Use
full English sentences where appropriate (namely almost everywhere)
and clear diagrams, programs, etc.  Remember that your goal is to
communicate clearly and that the appearance of these technical items
plays a role in this communication process.  Be sure your assignments
are either submitted online or stapled together with your name on them.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Gustavus Adolphus College is committed to ensuring the full participation of all students in its programs. If you have a documented disability (or you think you may have a disability of any nature) and, as a result, need reasonable academic accommodation to participate in class, take tests or benefit from the College’s services, then you should speak with the Disability Services staff, for a confidential discussion of your needs and appropriate plans. Course requirements cannot be waived, but reasonable accommodations may be provided based on disability documentation and course outcomes. Accommodations cannot be made retroactively; therefore, to maximize your academic success at Gustavus, please contact Disability Services as early as possible. Disability Services (<a href="https://gustavus.edu/advising/disability/">gustavus.edu/advising/disability/</a>) is located in the Academic Support Center. Disability Services Coordinator, Kelly Karstad, (<a href="mailto:kkarstad@gustavus.edu">kkarstad@gustavus.edu</a> or x7138), can provide further information.</p>

<p>
Support for English learners and multilingual students is available through the Academic Support Center’s Multilingual Learner Academic Specialist, Jody Bryant (<a href="mailto:jbryant2@gustavus.edu">jbryant2@gustavus.edu</a> or x7197). The MLAS can meet individually with students for tutoring in writing, consulting about academic tasks, and helping students connect with the College’s support systems. When requested, the MLAS can consult with faculty regarding effective classroom strategies for English learners and multilingual students. The MLAS can provide students with a letter to a professor that explains and supports appropriate academic arrangements (e.g., additional time on tests, additional revisions for papers). Professors make decisions based on those recommendations at their own discretion. In addition, English learners and multilingual students can seek help from peer tutors in the Writing Center (<a href="https://gustavus.edu/writingcenter/">gustavus.edu/writingcenter/</a>).
Please let me know if there is any
accommodation in the course that would enable you to more fully show
your abilities; for example, I would consider allowing extra time on
tests, as well as allowing a dictionary in an otherwise closed-book
test.</p>

<h2><a name="schedule"></a>Schedule</h2>


<p>In the reading column, a single number with no decimal point indicates
an entire chapter.  A number with three decimal points in it, such as
8.5.1.1 or 8.5.1.2, refers to the material under the first or second
heading within Section 8.5.1, even though those headings are not
actually numbered.</p>
